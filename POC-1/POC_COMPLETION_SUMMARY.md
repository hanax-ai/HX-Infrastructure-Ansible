## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Architecture Delivered
```
LiteLLM Gateway (192.168.10.18) ←→ PostgreSQL 17 (192.168.10.19)
       ↓                                      ↓
   SQLAlchemy ORM                     litellm_db database
   Connection Pooling                 requests + responses tables
   psycopg2 driver                    Foreign key relationships
```

### Database Schema
- **requests** table: 11 columns, BigInteger PK, JSON payload support
- **responses** table: 10 columns, FK to requests, CASCADE DELETE  
- **Indexing:** Strategic indexes on request_id, model, created_at
- **Relationships:** Proper FK constraints with referential integrity

### Key Features Validated
- ✅ SQLAlchemy 2.0 with DeclarativeBase
- ✅ PostgreSQL 17 with SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication  
- ✅ Connection pooling with pre-ping health checks
- ✅ JSON payload storage for flexible request/response data
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- ✅ Foreign key relationships with CASCADE operations
- ✅ Token usage and cost tracking
