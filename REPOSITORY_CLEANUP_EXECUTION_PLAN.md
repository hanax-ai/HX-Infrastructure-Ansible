# Repository Cleanup Execution Plan
## HX-Infrastructure-Ansible Repository

**Date:** September 26, 2025  
**Repository:** hanax-ai/HX-Infrastructure-Ansible  
**Current Branch Count:** 34+ branches  
**Cleanup Objective:** Streamline branch structure, implement governance, ensure security

---

## Executive Summary

This repository has accumulated 34+ branches with inconsistent naming conventions and organizational issues. This plan provides a systematic approach to clean up the repository while maintaining operational safety and implementing proper governance.

### Key Issues Identified:
- Multiple merge-fix branches (merge-fix-4, merge-fix-8, merge-fix-10, merge-fix-11, merge-fix-12)
- Temporary branches left unmerged (temp/workflow-validation)
- Copilot-generated branches (copilot/fix-*)
- Transfer work branches (transfer-work-*)
- Inconsistent feature branch naming
- No branch protection or governance policies

---

## Phase 1A: Safety + Control Operations

### 1A.1 Safety Snapshot
- **Action:** Create pre-cleanup tag and bare repository backup
- **Tag:** `pre-cleanup-snapshot-YYYYMMDD`
- **Backup:** Full bare clone for rollback capability
- **Retention:** 90 days minimum

### 1A.2 Branch Protection Implementation
- **Target:** main branch (primary) + phase-1.0-deployment (current default)
- **Rules:**
  - Require pull request reviews (1 reviewer minimum)
  - Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
  - Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Restrict pushes to matching branches
  - Allow force pushes: false
  - Allow deletions: false

### 1A.3 Security Scanning
- **Tool:** gitleaks for sensitive data detection
- **Scope:** All branches and commit history
- **Output:** JSON report for review
- **Action:** Address any findings before proceeding

### 1A.4 Branch Inventory & Analysis
- **Data Collection:**
  - Branch names and last commit dates
  - Commit authors and activity patterns
  - Merge status and relationships
  - Staleness analysis (>30 days inactive)

### 1A.5 Governance Setup
- **CODEOWNERS:** Define team ownership and review requirements
- **Documentation:** Update README with branch policies
- **Workflow Hardening:** Implement required status checks

## Branch Decision Matrix

### DELETE (High Confidence)
**Criteria:** Temporary, merge artifacts, or abandoned work
- `merge-fix-4, merge-fix-8, merge-fix-10, merge-fix-11, merge-fix-12` - Merge artifacts
- `temp/workflow-validation` - Temporary testing branch
- `copilot/fix-*` - AI-generated fix attempts
- `transfer-work-*` - Work transfer branches (if merged)

### CONSOLIDATE (Review Required)
**Criteria:** Related features that should be unified
- Phase/sprint feature branches with overlapping scope
- Multiple remediation branches addressing same issues
- Feature branches that can be rebased/squashed

### KEEP (Active/Critical)
**Criteria:** Active development, deployment, or recovery branches
- `main` - Primary branch
- `phase-1.0-deployment` - Current default/active deployment
- Active feature branches with recent commits
- Recovery/backup branches with unique value

---

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Archive-Before-Delete
- Create archive tags for all branches before deletion
- Format: `archive/branch-name-YYYYMMDD`
- Retention: 6 months minimum

### 2. Rollback Capability
- Full bare repository backup before any changes
- Step-by-step operation logging
- Immediate rollback procedures documented

### 3. Stakeholder Communication
- Engineering team notification before execution
- 48-hour review period for branch decisions
- Clear escalation path for concerns

### 4. Gradual Execution
- Phase-based approach with validation checkpoints
- Ability to pause/resume operations
- Continuous monitoring of repository health

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1A: Safety + Control (Day 1)
- [x] Safety snapshot and backup creation
- [x] Branch protection implementation
- [x] Security scanning execution
- [x] Initial inventory and analysis
- [x] CODEOWNERS and governance setup

### Phase 1B: Branch Decisions (Day 2)
- [ ] Stakeholder review of branch matrix
- [ ] Archive creation for deletion candidates
- [ ] Consolidation planning for related branches
- [ ] Final approval for cleanup operations

### Phase 1C: Cleanup Execution (Day 3)
- [ ] Branch deletions (with archives)
- [ ] Branch consolidations and merges
- [ ] Final repository validation
- [ ] Documentation updates

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Branch count reduction: Target 50%+ reduction (34+ â†’ <17)
- Stale branch elimination: 100% of branches >90 days inactive
- Security scan: 0 critical findings
- Protection coverage: 100% of primary branches

### Qualitative
- Clear branch naming conventions
- Documented ownership and policies
- Improved developer experience
- Reduced maintenance overhead

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback
1. Restore from bare repository backup
2. Force push to restore branch state
3. Notify stakeholders of rollback
4. Investigate and document issues

### Selective Rollback
1. Restore specific branches from archive tags
2. Recreate branch protection rules if needed
3. Update documentation to reflect changes
4. Communicate partial rollback to team

---

## Post-Cleanup Governance

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/description` - Critical production fixes
- `release/version` - Release preparation
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates

### Branch Lifecycle
- Maximum lifetime: 30 days for feature branches
- Required reviews: 1+ for all merges to protected branches
- Automatic deletion: Merged branches after 7 days
- Stale branch alerts: Weekly notifications for >14 days inactive

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Weekly branch health reports
- Monthly governance policy reviews
- Quarterly cleanup assessments
- Annual policy updates

**Plan Status:** Phase 1A Ready for Execution  
**Next Action:** Execute safety operations and create Phase 1A completion report
