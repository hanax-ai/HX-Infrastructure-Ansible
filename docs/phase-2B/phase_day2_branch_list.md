## Pre-Consolidation Checklist

### Branch Verification
- [ ] All 13 branches exist and are accessible
- [ ] No critical security issues in any branch
- [ ] All branches pass basic syntax validation
- [ ] Conflict analysis completed for each branch

### Safety Measures
- [ ] Pre-execution baseline captured
- [ ] Rollback stub template prepared
- [ ] Archive-before-merge strategy confirmed
- [ ] Emergency rollback procedures documented

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Ansible-lint passes on all branches
- [ ] YAML syntax validation completed
- [ ] No circular dependencies detected
- [ ] Documentation consistency verified

## Expected Outcomes

### Post-Consolidation State
- **Single Branch**: `phase-2-consolidated`
- **Combined Features**: All Phase 2 functionality in one branch
- **Reduced Complexity**: 13 branches → 1 consolidated branch
- **Maintained History**: Full commit history preserved via squash merge

### Quality Metrics
- **Conflict Resolution**: All LOW-level conflicts resolved
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained or improved
- **Documentation**: Updated and consolidated
- **Security Posture**: Enhanced through security branch integration

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Factors
- All branches assessed as LOW conflict level
- Comprehensive safety framework in place
- Proven consolidation methodology from Phase 2A
- Full rollback capability maintained

### Mitigation Strategies
- Squash merge strategy reduces merge complexity
- Acceptance gates ensure quality control
- Baseline drift monitoring detects issues early
- Archive retention provides recovery options

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] All 13 branches successfully merged
- [ ] No merge conflicts remain unresolved
- [ ] All tests pass on consolidated branch
- [ ] Baseline drift within acceptable limits

### Process Success
- [ ] Rollback stub generated and validated
- [ ] Engineering team approval obtained
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of completion

## Emergency Procedures

### If Consolidation Fails
1. Execute rollback stub: `docs/phase-2B/day2_rollback.sh`
2. Analyze failure from drift report
3. Coordinate with engineering team
4. Plan remediation strategy

### Escalation Path
1. **Level 1**: Repository maintainers
2. **Level 2**: Engineering team lead
3. **Level 3**: Project management
4. **Level 4**: Executive stakeholders
