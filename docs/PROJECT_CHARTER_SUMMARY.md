# HX Infrastructure Project Charter Summary

## Original Project Objectives

Based on the available documentation and repository structure, the HX Infrastructure project was established with the following key objectives:

### üéØ Primary Goals

#### 1. Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure Automation
- **Objective**: Deploy and manage enterprise-scale infrastructure using Ansible
- **Scope**: 15-server architecture with multi-tier redundancy
- **Technology Stack**: Ansible-based configuration management and deployment

#### 2. High Availability and Scalability
- **Architecture Principles**:
  - Multi-tier redundancy with failover capabilities
  - Horizontal scaling across all infrastructure tiers
  - Load balancing and traffic distribution
  - Database replication and caching layers

#### 3. Security-First Design
- **Security Model**: Defense-in-depth security architecture
- **Components**:
  - SSL/TLS termination and certificate management
  - Network segmentation (DMZ, private tiers)
  - Access control and authentication systems
  - Comprehensive audit logging

#### 4. Operational Excellence
- **Maintainability**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- **Automation**: Standardized deployment and configuration processes
- **Quality Assurance**: CI/CD integration with automated testing

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Architecture

#### Multi-Tier Architecture (15 Servers)
1. **Load Balancer Tier** (2 servers): nginx + keepalived with SSL termination
2. **Web Tier** (3 servers): nginx + static content with CDN integration
3. **Application Tier** (3 servers): Application runtime with auto-scaling
4. **Database Tier** (3 servers): PostgreSQL 15 with master-replica setup
5. **Cache Tier** (2 servers): Redis for session storage and caching
6. **Monitoring Tier** (2 servers): Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack
