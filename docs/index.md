# HX Infrastructure Ansible - Documentation Index

## Overview

This repository contains the Ansible automation for HX Infrastructure, implementing a comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution with advanced monitoring, security hardening, and operational excellence features.

## Phase 2C: Integration & Standardization

Phase 2C focuses on integrating all components built in Phase 2A and 2B, establishing standardized processes, and implementing machine-checkable quality gates.

### Key Features

- **Machine-Checkable Gates**: Automated validation of integration, performance, and security
- **Golden-Path Integration Tests**: End-to-end validation of critical workflows
- **Quantified SLOs**: Hard performance thresholds with automated measurement
- **Unified CI Pipeline**: Standardized build and deployment processes
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Consolidated and structured documentation framework

## Quality Gates

### Integration Gate (`make gate-integration`)

Validates:
- Ansible syntax and structure
- Role dependencies
- Inventory configuration
- Template rendering
- Vault file security
- Golden path integration

**SLO**: Must pass 100% of checks

### Performance Gate (`make gate-performance`)

Validates:
- P95 deploy time ≤ 8 minutes
- Playbook runtime ≤ 90 seconds
- Role execution ≤ 30 seconds
- Template render ≤ 5 seconds
- Vault decrypt ≤ 2 seconds

**SLO**: Must meet all performance thresholds

### Security Gate (`make gate-security`)

Validates:
- Vault encryption compliance
- Sensitive data exposure
- SSH key security
- File permissions
- Security best practices
- Compliance requirements

**SLO**: Must pass 100% of security checks

## Golden Path Tests

### Blue-Green Deployment (`tests/golden_path/blue_green.sh`)

End-to-end validation of:
- Blue environment deployment
- Health check validation
- Traffic switching
- Green environment deployment
- Rollback procedures
- Performance metrics

### Monitoring Pipeline (`tests/golden_path/monitoring.sh`)

End-to-end validation of:
- Metric collection
- Dashboard rendering
- Alert evaluation
- Notification delivery
- Performance validation

### Self-Healing System (`tests/golden_path/self_healing.sh`)

End-to-end validation of:
- Fault detection
- Automated recovery
- System convergence
- Rollback mechanisms
- Performance metrics

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

| Metric | Threshold | Measurement |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Deploy Time (P95) | ≤ 8 minutes | End-to-end deployment |
| Playbook Runtime | ≤ 90 seconds | Individual playbook execution |
| Role Execution | ≤ 30 seconds | Per role execution time |
| Template Render | ≤ 5 seconds | Template processing time |
| Vault Decrypt | ≤ 2 seconds | Vault file access time |
| Health Check | ≤ 10 seconds | Service health validation |
| Alert Response | ≤ 5 minutes | Alert to notification time |
| Recovery Time | ≤ 60 seconds | Fault to recovery completion |

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline implements the following stages:

1. **Integration Gate** - Syntax and structure validation
2. **Performance Gate** - SLO compliance validation
3. **Security Gate** - Security compliance validation
4. **Golden Path Tests** - End-to-end workflow validation
5. **Documentation Validation** - Documentation completeness
6. **Phase 2C Completion Gate** - Overall readiness validation

### Branch Protection

The following contexts are required for merge:

- `Integration Gate`
- `Performance Gate`
- `Security Gate`
- `Golden Path Tests`
- `Lint and Syntax Check`
- `Security Scan`
- `Monitoring Validation`
- `Documentation Validation`

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   - Create feature branch from `develop`
   - Implement changes following coding standards
   - Run local quality gates
   - Submit pull request

2. **Quality Validation**
   - Automated CI pipeline execution
   - All gates must pass
   - Peer review required
   - Documentation updates required

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Golden path tests execution
   - Performance validation
   - Security compliance check

4. **Deployment**
   - Merge to `main` branch
   - Automated deployment to staging
   - Production deployment approval
   - Post-deployment validation
