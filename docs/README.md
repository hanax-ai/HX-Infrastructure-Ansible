# HX Infrastructure Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the HX Infrastructure project, addressing all aspects of configuration management, deployment procedures, and operational processes.

## Recent Updates (Phase 4.0)

Following comprehensive feedback, the documentation has been systematically refined to address:

1. **Consolidated Ansible Configuration**: Clear distinction between control node and development configurations
2. **Standardized Inventory Management**: Migration to YAML format with consistent structure
3. **Enhanced Discovery Process**: Integrated process for new service discoveries with service-specific SOPs
4. **Improved Prompt Guide**: Living examples demonstrating effective documentation generation
5. **Comprehensive Standards**: Complete documentation standards with quality assurance framework

## Documentation Structure

## Quick Start Guide

### For New Team Members
1. Start with [Documentation Standards](standards/Documentation_Standards.md) to understand our approach
2. Review [Ansible Configuration](ansible/README.md) to understand configuration management
3. Study [Inventory Management](inventory/README.md) for infrastructure organization
4. Learn the [Process for New Discoveries](process/new_discoveries.md) for contributing

### For Documentation Contributors
1. Use [Prompt Templates](examples/prompt_templates.md) for consistent documentation generation
2. Follow [Documentation Standards](standards/Documentation_Standards.md) for quality assurance
3. Reference [Generative Prompt Guide](generative_prompt_guide.md) for effective AI-assisted documentation

### For Infrastructure Operators
1. Reference [Ansible Configuration](ansible/README.md) for deployment configuration
2. Use [Inventory Management](inventory/README.md) for environment-specific operations
3. Follow [Process for New Discoveries](process/new_discoveries.md) when adding new services

## Configuration Standards Summary

### Ansible Configuration
- **Production**: Use main `ansible.cfg` for control node operations
- **Development**: Use `ansible-dev.cfg` for local development and testing
- **Inventory**: Standardized YAML format under `inventories/` (transitioning to `inventory/environments/`)

### Inventory Format
- **Standard**: YAML format for all environments
- **Structure**: Hierarchical service organization (infrastructure, ai_ml, ui, operations)
- **Migration**: Complete guide available for INI to YAML conversion

### Documentation Process
- **Discovery**: Systematic process for new infrastructure elements
- **Integration**: Service-specific SOPs with pre-filled templates
- **Quality**: Comprehensive standards with automated checks
- **Maintenance**: Regular review and update procedures

## Feedback Integration
