# HX Infrastructure - Phase 3.4 Operations Documentation

## Production Operations and Maintenance Automation

This documentation covers the comprehensive production operations and maintenance automation framework implemented in Phase 3.4 of the HX Infrastructure project.

## Overview

Phase 3.4 introduces enterprise-grade production operations capabilities including:

- **Production Deployment Framework**: Zero-downtime deployments with blue-green and canary strategies
- **Service Management Automation**: Comprehensive service lifecycle management with auto-recovery
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time system and application performance monitoring
- **Maintenance Automation**: Automated maintenance windows and system updates
- **Incident Response**: Automated incident detection, classification, and remediation

## Quick Start

### Running Production Deployments

```bash
# Blue-Green Deployment
ansible-playbook -i inventory/production playbooks/production/deployment/blue_green_deploy.yml

# Canary Deployment
ansible-playbook -i inventory/production playbooks/production/deployment/canary_deploy.yml \
  -e canary_traffic_percentage=20 -e canary_monitoring_time=900
```

### Health Monitoring

```bash
# Comprehensive health check
ansible-playbook -i inventory/production playbooks/production/operations/health_monitoring.yml

# Service management
ansible-playbook -i inventory/production playbooks/production/operations/service_management.yml
```

### Maintenance Operations

```bash
# Automated maintenance window
ansible-playbook -i inventory/production playbooks/production/maintenance/automated_maintenance.yml

# System updates and patching
ansible-playbook -i inventory/production playbooks/production/maintenance/system_updates.yml
```

- Dependency management
- Graceful shutdown procedures

### 3. Comprehensive Monitoring
- System resource monitoring
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- SLA monitoring and reporting
- Predictive failure detection

### 4. Maintenance Automation
- Scheduled maintenance windows
- Automated system updates and patching
- Database maintenance and optimization
- Compliance reporting

### 5. Incident Response
- Automated incident detection
- Classification and escalation
- Auto-remediation for common issues
- Post-incident analysis

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Key configuration variables for production operations:

```yaml
# Deployment Configuration
deployment_strategy: "blue_green"  # or "canary"
health_check_timeout: 300
rollback_enabled: true

# Monitoring Thresholds
alert_thresholds:
  cpu_usage: 80
  memory_usage: 85
  disk_usage: 90
  response_time: 2000
  error_rate: 5

# Maintenance Windows
maintenance_window_start: 2  # 2 AM
maintenance_window_end: 6    # 6 AM
enforce_maintenance_window: true
```

## Security and Compliance

- Production security hardening
- Compliance validation automation
- Audit logging and reporting
- Access control and authorization
- Security scanning integration

## Integration

Phase 3.4 integrates with previous phases:
- **Phase 3.1**: Service integration and orchestration
- **Phase 3.2**: Monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- **Phase 3.3**: Backup and disaster recovery automation

## Support and Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting guides and operational procedures, see:
- [Runbooks](runbooks/)
- [Procedures](procedures/)
- [Dashboard Documentation](dashboards/)

## Best Practices

1. **Always test deployments in staging first**
2. **Monitor health checks during deployments**
3. **Maintain recent backups before maintenance**
4. **Follow maintenance window schedules**
5. **Document all incidents and resolutions**

## Contributing

When contributing to production operations:
1. Follow enterprise Ansible best practices
2. Include comprehensive error handling
3. Add appropriate documentation
4. Test in staging environment first
5. Update monitoring and alerting as needed
