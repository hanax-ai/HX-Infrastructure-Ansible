# Generative Prompt Guide with Living Examples

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to effectively use generative AI prompts to create, maintain, and improve HX Infrastructure documentation. It includes real-world examples from our actual project documentation and shows the effectiveness of prompt-driven documentation generation.

## Core Principles

### 1. Context-Rich Prompting
Provide comprehensive context about the infrastructure, services, and requirements to generate accurate and relevant documentation.

### 2. Structured Output Requests
Request specific formats, sections, and structures to ensure consistency across documentation.

### 3. Iterative Refinement
Use follow-up prompts to refine and improve generated content based on specific requirements.

### 4. Integration Awareness
Ensure prompts consider existing documentation and maintain consistency with established patterns.

## Living Examples from HX Infrastructure

### Example 1: Service Documentation Generation

**Prompt Used:**
```
Create comprehensive documentation for the HX Infrastructure AI/ML services including LiteLLM gateway, Ollama services, and model storage. Include:
- Service architecture overview
- Configuration requirements
- Deployment procedures
- Monitoring and troubleshooting
- Integration with other services

Use the existing inventory structure from inventories/dev/hosts.yml and maintain consistency with our documentation standards.
```

- ✅ Provided practical ticket templates
- ✅ Included troubleshooting guidance
- ✅ Maintained consistency with existing documentation patterns

### Example 3: Configuration Documentation

**Prompt Used:**
```
Address the feedback about ansible.cfg variations by creating documentation that:
- Explains the difference between control node and development configurations
- Provides clear guidance on when to use each
- Documents the rationale for configuration choices
- Includes migration guidance for inventory format standardization
- Maintains consistency with our YAML-first approach
```

**Generated Output Highlights:**
- ✅ Clear distinction between configuration types
- ✅ Practical usage guidelines
- ✅ Migration path documentation
- ✅ Integration with broader standards

Format: Use markdown with code examples, include comparison tables for variations, and maintain consistency with infrastructure documentation standards.
```

## Before/After Examples

### Before: Generic Configuration Documentation
```markdown
# Ansible Configuration

This project uses Ansible for automation.

## Configuration File
The ansible.cfg file contains settings for Ansible.

## Inventory
Inventory files define the hosts.
```

### After: Prompt-Generated Documentation
```markdown
# Ansible Configuration Management

## Overview
The HX Infrastructure project uses a standardized Ansible configuration approach with environment-specific settings and clear separation between control node and development configurations.

## Configuration Files

### Primary Configuration: `ansible.cfg`
The main `ansible.cfg` file in the project root is configured for **production control node operations**:
- **Inventory**: Points to `inventory/environments/production`
- **Performance**: Optimized for production deployments with smart gathering and fact caching
- **Security**: Configured with vault password file and secure SSH settings
- **Logging**: Full logging enabled for audit trails

### Development Configuration
For development and testing purposes, developers should create a local `ansible-dev.cfg` file with:

Include relevant configuration files, inventory structures, and existing documentation patterns in your prompts.

### 2. Request Specific Formats
Ask for markdown with specific heading structures, code block formatting, and table layouts that match existing documentation.

### 3. Include Integration Requirements
Specify how the generated documentation should integrate with existing documents and processes.

### 4. Validate and Refine
Use follow-up prompts to refine generated content based on technical accuracy and consistency requirements.

### 5. Maintain Living Examples
Regularly update this guide with new examples and effectiveness demonstrations from actual project work.

## Common Prompt Patterns

### Pattern 1: Context + Requirements + Format
```
[Detailed context about current state]
[Specific requirements for output]
[Format and integration specifications]
```

### Pattern 2: Problem + Solution + Integration
```
[Description of documentation gap or issue]
[Required solution approach]
[Integration with existing documentation]
```

### Pattern 3: Update + Consistency + Validation
```
[Current documentation to update]
[Consistency requirements with existing docs]
[Validation criteria for accuracy]
```

## Integration with Documentation Workflow

### 1. Discovery Phase
Use prompts to generate initial documentation drafts based on discovered services or requirements.

### 2. Review Phase
Use prompts to identify gaps, inconsistencies, or improvement opportunities in existing documentation.

### 3. Update Phase
Use prompts to maintain consistency when updating documentation across multiple related documents.

### 4. Quality Assurance Phase
Use prompts to validate documentation completeness and accuracy against established standards.
